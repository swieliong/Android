    Theme vs Style
    Well they are both declared in exactly the same way (which you already know), the difference comes in how theyâ€™re used.
    Themes are meant to be the global source of styling for your app.
        AndroidManifest.xml - <application android:theme="@style/CustomFontStyle">
    Styles are meant to be applied at a view level.
        <activity android:theme="@style/CustomFontStyle">
    -->

    <!-- Base application theme. -->
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">
        <!-- Customize your theme here. -->
    </style>
